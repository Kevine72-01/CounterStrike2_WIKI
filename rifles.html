                    The FAMAS, or Clarion 5.56, as it was previously known, is a rifle featured in the Counter-Strike series.
                    In-game, the FAMAS is a cheap and fairly powerful assault rifle available exclusively to the Counter-Terrorists, and the cheapest CT assault rifle at $2050 in Global Offensive and $2250 in Counter-Strike, Condition Zero and Source.
                    The FAMAS is one of the two weapons in the Counter-Strike series with a burst firing mode, the other being the Glock-18. 
                    The player receives the weapon in full-automatic mode, and can switch to the burst mode with the alternate fire key, and can switch back to semi-automatic fire by using the alternate fire key again. 
                    In Global Offensive, switching the fire mode makes a distinctive "click" noise audible to all players.
                    Burst-fire slightly increases the rate of fire and slightly increases accuracy and decreases recoil during the burst, but increases the delay between individual bursts.
                    The FAMAS deals low damage for an assault rifle, and has a smaller magazine size at 25 rounds compared to 30 rounds of other assault rifles. 
                </p>

                                It also has a longer reload time than other assault rifles.
                                Overall, despite its unique features, the FAMAS is best used as an eco round CT assault rifle, and is usually discarded in buy rounds for more powerful weapons. 
                                However, should they use the alternative three-burst mode, they appear notably overpowered at long range even in easy mode due to their excellent overall accuracy.

                    The Galil AR is a Terrorist rifle featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2. 
                    It is the successor to the IDF Defender in previous Counter-Strike games, having similar statistics and the same role as its predecessor. 
                    In-game, the Galil AR costs $1800, making it the cheapest Terrorist assault rifle. It has a high rate of fire but moderately strong recoil. 
                    It holds 35 rounds in its magazine, 5 more than most other assault rifles, and has a good penetration power. 
                    Its primary disadvantage is that it cannot instantly kill targets at full health and armor with a single headshot, and accuracy is somewhat low at long range.
                    In general, the Galil AR is a good choice for an eco round assault rifle, but is not very good for buy rounds.
                    For close-quarter combat and at medium ranges, fire full-auto, preferable at the chest of a target.
                    While very cheap and more accurate while spraying, it's usually better to save up for AK-47 instead, since the Galil AR will often lose to the stronger, more accurate rifles.

                                T's who can't buy the AK-47, but are also looking for a cheaper, more rewarding option may want to opt for SMG's like the UMP-45 instead for garnering twice the kill reward.
                                The Galil AR is modeled after the Galil ACE 22, an Israeli assault rifle manufactured by Israel Weapon Industries. 
                                The ACE 22 is the medium barrel version of the IWI Galil ACE series, produced since 2008. 
                                Its in-game name comes from a different weapon in the same family, the Galil AR.

                    The AUG, or Bullpup, as it was previously known, is a rifle featured in the Counter-Strike series, exclusive to the Counter-Terrorists. 
                    The counterpart for the Terrorists is the Krieg 552 and SG 553 in Global Offensive.
                    It is equipped with a low power scope for medium range engagement.  
                    The player will leave the scope if they use secondary fire again after scoped in or switches weapons. 
                    The AUG has an average rate of fire - on par with the AK-47 and M4A1-S - and deals moderate damage. 
                    In Global Offensive, the AUG is able to instantly kill a full health helmet-wearing player with one headshot at point blank range. 
                    However, because the damage is 100 flat, any additional range will cause damage dropoff and make the feat impossible.
                    The AUG has good accuracy and moderately strong recoil. 
                    It has the highest first shot accuracy out of all assault rifles when scoped in. 
                    Recoil is strong when fired full-auto (when unscoped), but the first few shots have controllable recoil so firing short bursts of 1-3 shots is viable. 
                </p>

                                In competitive matches, it is used alongside the M4s due to its accuracy and damage, despite its higher price and longer reload times.
                                The AUG is the main weapon for bots who have weapon preferences of wielding scoped assault rifle. And they do not make use of the scope. 
                                Oddly, bots with Terrorist preference of scoped rifle also prioritize on this weapon over the Krieg 552/SG 553 due to same weapon order in it's template.

                    The SG 553 is a Swiss assault rifle in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2 exclusive to the Terrorists. 
                    It is the successor to the Krieg 552 in previous Counter-Strike games, having the same role as its predecessor. Its Counter-Terrorist counterpart is the AUG.
                    In-game, the SG 553 serves as the successor of the Krieg 552 from previous titles. 
                    Like the Krieg 552, the SG 553 is equipped with a telescopic sight. 
                    The player can enter the scope by using secondary fire. 
                    The player will leave the scope if they use secondary fire again or switch weapons.
                    While scoped in, the player's view is zoomed in by 3x, recoil is significantly lowered, accuracy is increased, and the player's movement speed is reduced considerably. 
                    Unlike the Krieg 552, there is no longer a fire rate penalty for using the scope.
                    The scope now also provides a HUD overlay of the scope, including an aiming reticle, giving the impression of the player actually aiming down the scope.

                                Spraying for an extended burst whilst using the scope causes the scope dot to gradually disappear.
                                The SG 553 has slightly less base damage than the AK-47, but is the only weapon with 100% armor penetration, while the AK-47 has 77.5% armor penetration, meaning that it deals more damage to armored enemies than the AK-47, and is also the highest of any assault rifle. 
                                The SG 553 is one of the few guns capable of scoring fatal headshots regardless of armor.

                    The M4A4 is a Counter-Terrorist rifle featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2, replacing the previous Maverick M4A1 Carbine. 
                    In Global Offensive, it has the M4A1-S as its alternative loadout. 
                    The M4A4 is based on the Mk 18 Mod 0 carbine, fitted with an ARMS#40 flip-up rear iron sight and KAC free-float RAS handguard with rail covers.
                    This rifle is derived from the standard M4A1, but uses a different upper receiver (known as the Close Quarters Battle Receiver). 
                    This allows for the use of a shorter barrel - very useful for fighting in tight spaces.
                    In-game, the weapon holds 30 rounds and has 90 rounds in reserve.

                                The M4A4 has high accuracy and moderate recoil, making it good for firing bursts. 
                                However, spraying is not always recommended, unless the enemy is in close proximity. 
                                At longer ranges, it is better to burst fire or tap fire.
                                In medium and close ranges, the M4A4 can spray bullets at the torso or stomach and quickly deliver lots of accurate shots.
                                Crouching can quickly and easily compensate for the early-spray recoil.

                    The M4A1-S is a Counter-Terrorist exclusive rifle in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2, which was added in the game on the August 14, 2013 Arms Deal update. 
                    In Global Offensive, it is an alternative to the M4A4, replacing it if equipped in the loadout. 
                    It is a successor of the Maverick M4A1 Carbine from previous Counter-Strike games.
                    In game, the weapon's capacity and reserve capacity is reduced compared to its predecessor, at 20 rounds per magazine and 80 rounds in reserve, which is the lowest out of all assault rifles. 
                    Its rate of fire is slightly lowered at 600 RPM, slightly lower than the average assault rifle fire-rate or 667.
                    The M4A1-S is equipped with a silencer, which is attached when receiving the weapon, and can be manually detached (and reattached) by pressing the secondary fire key. 
                    The time taken for detaching and reattaching the silencer is greatly increased, so it is unadvised to do it in the midst of combat.

                    The AK-47, or CV-47 as it was previously known before Global Offensive, is a rifle featured in the Counter-Strike series, exclusively available to the Terrorists. 
                    The counterpart for the Counter-Terrorists is the Maverick M4A1 Carbine before Global Offensive and the M4A4 / M4A1-S in Global Offensive.
                    In-game, the AK-47 is a powerful assault rifle exclusive to the Terrorists. 
                    It is one of the most popular and efficient guns in the game known for its power, range, and cheap price. 
                    The AK-47 can kill a helmeted player with one shot to the head, something which its CT counterparts (Maverick M4A1 Carbine, M4A4, and M4A1-S) cannot do. 
                    Even without headshots, it is able to bring down an enemy in 4 Chest & Arm shots instead of 5 with the CT counterparts. 
                    It has high first shot accuracy and low damage dropoff, and a moderately fast reload. 
                    In Global Offensive, the first 8-9 bullets in its spray pattern have little to no side to side recoil, making compensation somewhat simple.

                                The AK-47's only major disadvantages are its inaccuracy after multiple shots and high recoil. 
                                In Global Offensive, the upwards recoil in the first few shots of its spray pattern is quite strong, requiring more mouse movement to compensate. 
                                After that, the recoil moves to strong side-to-side sway, which is harder to compensate. 
                                It is also one of the loudest rifles and has a very distinctive firing noise, allowing enemies to easily identify users of the AK-47.

                    The SSG 08 is a bolt-action sniper rifle in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2, replacing the Schmidt Scout from the previous games.
                    The SSG 08 is commonly nicknamed Scout due to its heavy physical resemblance to its predecessor.
                    Being bolt-action, the SSG 08 has a very low rate of fire, though a little faster than the AWP. 
                    It also has a long reload time like the AWP. It has good bullet penetration power. 
                    Like the Scout, the weapon is lightweight for a sniper rifle, but players will not gain a speed bonus with SSG 08 out and will have a speed of 230 units per second.
                    As a sniper rifle, the weapon is equipped with a high power lens scope for long range engagement. When not scoped in, the rifle is inaccurate (though better than the AWP) and has no crosshair to assist aiming.
                    The scope can be used with secondary fire, and pressing secondary fire again while scoped in zooms in the scope.
                    Unlike other sniper rifles, the player's movement speed is not reduced while scoped in.

                                Firing the weapon causes the player to leave the scope temporarily to operate the bolt before automatically scoping in again. 
                                The player will leave the scope if they use secondary fire again at the higher zoom setting or switches weapons.
                                When zoomed in and not moving, the rifle has a near-perfect accuracy, able to hit anything as long as the crosshair of the scope is on target. 
                                Moving drastically reduces accuracy, and even more so with jumping.

                    The SCAR-20 is a automatic sniper rifle in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2 that is exclusive to the Counter-Terrorists. 
                    It is the successor to the Krieg 550 Commando in previous games, having similar statistics and the same role as its predecessor.
                    In-game, the SCAR-20 is the CTs' automatic sniper rifle. 
                    Though technically referred to as a semi-automatic rifle in its description, it can be fired continuously as long as the player holds down the firing key.
                    As a sniper rifle, the weapon is equipped with a high-power scope. 
                    When not scoped in, the rifle is very inaccurate and has no crosshair to assist aiming. 
                    The scope can be used with secondary fire, and pressing secondary fire again while scoped in zooms in the scope. 
                    The player's movement speed is reduced while scoped in. 
                    The player will leave the scope if they use secondary fire again at the higher zoom setting or switches weapons.
                    It has high rate of fire, high accuracy, controllable recoil, fast reload, as well as a high tagging factor.

                                It has high damage, though unlike the AWP it cannot instantly kill an enemy with one shot to the body. 
                                These properties make the weapon overall easy to use, since it can easily pin down enemies and deal incredible amounts of damage.
                                The main factor that balances out the weapon is its very hefty price tag, the most expensive rifle alongside the G3SG1. 
                                Due to its price tag and the inability to instant kill an enemy with one shot to the body the SCAR-20 is rarely used in Competitive gameplay.

                    The G3SG1, or D3/AU-1, as it was previously known, is an automatic sniper rifle featured in the Counter-Strike series.
                    In-game, the G3SG/1 is a powerful marksman rifle available exclusively to the Terrorists. 
                    It is the most expensive Terrorist rifle option at $5000, making it one of the most expensive weapons in the game after the M249. 
                    It is not available in Assassination maps.
                    Being automatic, the player may hold the fire button down for full automatic fire (the player character will simply pull the trigger repeatedly), allowing for a constant damage output in contrast to other, bolt-action, sniper rifles.
                    As a sniper rifle, the weapon is equipped with a high-power scope. 
                    When not scoped in, the rifle is very inaccurate and has no crosshair to assist aiming, though it is better than that of the AWP and has very little accuracy penalties with moving in Counter-Strike.
                    The scope can be used with secondary fire, and pressing secondary fire again while scoped in zooms in the scope.

                                It deals relatively high damage (lower than the AWP, which can instantly kill any player with one shot) and is able to kill players at full health with two hits. 
                                Headshots are always instant kills. Recoil is quite strong, though slightly lower than the SCAR-20.

                    The AWP, or Magnum Sniper Rifle, as it was previously known, is a sniper rifle featured in the Counter-Strike series.
                    Considered a "high risk, high reward" weapon due to its high damage but slow firing rate, reload speed, and movement speed, the AWP is one of the most used weapons in the Counter-Strike series.
                    In-game, the AWP is a high-powered bolt-action sniper rifle available to both teams, with a 5-round magazine capacity in Counter-Strike 2 and Global Offensive whereas in earlier games it has a 10-round magazine. 
                    The AWP is not available for the Counter-Terrorists to purchase in Assassination maps. 
                    They can, however, get them from fallen Terrorists.
                    It is a devastatingly powerful long-range weapon, with extreme accuracy and obscene stopping power. 
                    However, its high price tag and cumbersome playstyle requires massive amounts of training, practice, accuracy and experience to master its usage.
                    When not scoped in, the rifle is very inaccurate and has no crosshair to assist aiming.
