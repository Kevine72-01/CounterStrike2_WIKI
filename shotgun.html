                    The Sawed-Off is a pump-action shotgun featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2. 
                    It is exclusive to the Terrorists. The counterpart of this weapon for the Counter-Terrorists is the MAG-7.
                    In-game, the gun holds 7 rounds of 12 gauge ammunition with 32 shells held in reserve. 
                    Being a pump-action shotgun, it has a very slow rate of fire, but inflicts very high damage, which can kill an enemy with just one shot at close range with at least 5 pellets hitting.
                    Despite its appearance, it is also heavier than any other shotgun. However, it loses little accuracy while moving, which means it can be used effectively while running.

                                At medium range however, two to three shots are needed due to the shotgun's high spread, the highest among the shotguns. 
                                Its high spread means that very few pellets will land on target at even slightly longer ranges and beyond 1408 hammer units, the pellets will actually disappear, further restricting its range potential.
                                The reloading process involves individually loading new shells into the weapon's loading port. 
                                It is possible to interrupt the reload and fire mid-reload by pressing the primary attack key during the reload.
                                The weapon is inexpensive at $1100, almost being the cheapest shotgun, second only to the Nova. 
                                It has a 3x kill award multiplier, rewarding $900 per kill in Competitive, allowing it to easily recoup its price.

                    The MAG-7 is a pump-action shotgun featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2, exclusive to the Counter-Terrorists. 
                    The counterpart of this weapon is the Terrorists' Sawed-Off.
                    In-game, the MAG-7 is a very cost-effective and high-damaging CT-exclusive shotgun. 
                    It inflicts very high damage at close range, able to kill instantly to any bodypart as long as all pellets hit, and has better armor penetration than the Nova, so not as many shots need to land to instantly kill even if the enemies are armored. 
                    It is somewhat more accurate than the other shotguns, with a good accuracy even while jumping and moving, but damage dropoff is more significant.

                                It is also the lightest shotgun in Global Offensive, though still very slow compared to many other weapons.
                                Being a pump-action shotgun, it has a very low rate of fire, and has the lowest magazine capacity out of all shotguns, meaning that it is more suitable for an ambushing playstyle instead of direct combat, where the player can create a close-range engagement against one enemy player and guarantee a kill.
                                The MAG-7 uniquely has a detachable magazine instead of a fixed magazine like on other shotguns. 
                                Whereas other shotguns require individual shells to be loaded through the loading gate, the MAG-7 can replace its magazine entirely in one go, giving it a fast general reload time and fastest reload time when compared to emptied shotguns.

                    The Nova is a pump-action shotgun that appears in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2. 
                    It replaces the Leone 12 Gauge Super from early Counter-Strike games.
                    As the cheapest shotgun option, it has low power but is a good economic investment due to having high kill rewards. 
                    It has a slow rate of fire due to the pump-action, even slightly lower compared to the Sawed-Off and MAG-7 68 RPM vs. 71 RPM.
                    At extreme close range, the shotgun can kill in one shot to any body part if all pellets hit. 
                    However, the shotgun has the lowest armor penetration out of all shotguns, meaning that more shots need to land in order to instantly kill armored enemies compared to other shotguns. 
                    This reduces its effectiveness significantly against armored opponents, but it compensates somewhat with the lowest pellet spread compared to the other shotguns, allowing for more kill potential at range.

                                The reloading process involves individually loading new shells into the weapon's loading port. 
                                It is possible to interrupt the reload and fire mid-reload by pressing the primary attack key during the reload.
                                In Competitive, one kill rewards $900, whilst in Casual, it's $450 per kill.
                                Thanks to its tight spread and more forgiving maximum range and falloff modifier, the Nova can make a serviceable buy round option.
                                One thing to be most wary of when using the Nova is that its damage can be very inconsistent at any range. On one hand, you might somehow miraculously snipe a target and make back the amount spent on the gun out of the exchange, but on the other, fail to kill, even when perfectly aiming dead-center.

                    The XM1014, or Leone YG1265 Auto Shotgun, as it was previously known, is one of the shotguns featured in the Counter-Strike series. 
                    This shotgun is not available for Terrorists to purchase in Assassination.
                    In all games, it is the most expensive shotgun option, at $3000 in earlier games and $2000 in Global Offensive. 
                    This makes the shotgun less viable as an eco option, but it is still cheaper than other weapons in Global Offensive. 
                    It also has a high kill reward ($900) in Global Offensive, making economic recovery easier.

                                Compared to the pump-action shotguns, it has a higher rate of fire due to being automatic. 
                                Having a high rate of fire also means that recoil becomes a meaningful factor that the player needs to control in addition to spread.
                                Balancing out its superior fire rate is its lower per-shot power. 
                                Being a shotgun, it still has high damage at close range, but it has less pellets per shot compared to other shotguns (6 vs. 8 in Global Offensive) and more pellets need to land in order to kill in one shot.
                                The weapon is lightweight in earlier games, but is made much heavier in Global Offensive.
