                    The HE Grenade (HE standing for High Explosive) is a type of grenade available in the Counter-Strike series. 
                    Players can hold only one HE grenade at a time, excluding in Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, where they may hold three at once. 
                    In Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, the HE grenade is a retextured version of the cut CS Grenade, which in turn was modeled after the M7A3 CS Grenade. 
                    In Counter-Strike: Source, it is modeled after the M26 grenade, and in Global Offensive, it is modeled after the M67 grenade, both of which fragmentation grenades in reality, though behave in-game as high explosive grenades, damaging only through their explosion instead of releasing shrapnel.
                    Bots with HE grenades will sometimes throw them at walls or other obstructions so players should be cautious when following friendly bots with grenades when friendly fire is enabled, especially in 1.6 and Condition Zero. 
                    Prior to Global Offensive, if the player issued the command "GO! GO! GO!", bots will switch to their firearm (if they agree with that command).
                </p>

                                Damage from an HE Grenade is affected by what hitboxes its explosion touches.
                                The hitbox that takes the maximum damage is positioned from the waist to above the head.
                                In Global Offensive, the maximum blast radius is 384 units (or six head-height crates).
                                If the player is out in the open and has been spotted, using an HE grenade can distract the enemies and allow the player to escape.

                    The Molotov Cocktail, known simply as Molotov in Global Offensive, is a grenade featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, exclusive to the Terrorists. 
                    The counterpart for Counter-Terrorists is the Incendiary Grenade.
                    In-game, the Molotov is a terrorist exclusive grenade, and their most expensive T grenade at $400. 
                    It is useful both as a defensive and offensive tool. 
                    Defensively, the flames are excellent at temporarily preventing enemies from advancing to an important area (such as a bombsite, important pathways, or the hostages), or preventing enemies from rushing the player with close-ranged weaponry. 
                    The molotov is also fantastic at denying the defusal of the C4 Explosive once it is planted. 
                    Offensively, the flames can be thrown into a defensive position that an enemy is hiding in, trapping the enemy in flames, forcing them to come out or take damage.
                    When thrown, the bottle would shatter upon hitting a walkable surface that is 30 degrees or smaller from horizontal, spreading the flammable liquid around and creating an area of flames capable of burning anybody that is in it.

                                The bottle will not shatter and will bounce off all other surfaces. 
                                Flying for more than 2 seconds will cause the Molotov to explode mid-air, releasing nothing and damaging nobody.
                                The only exception is if the molotov explodes less than 128 units above a surface, in which case the flames will drop to the ground and begin to burn.
                                The flame starts dealing 1 damage and increasing each hit up to 8 where it is capped.

                    The Flashbang is a type of grenade available in the Counter-Strike series.
                    Unlike other grenades, players can hold two flashbangs at once for most games. 
                    In the Deleted Scenes, players may even carry three at once. 
                    Only one flashbang can be purchased/obtained in Classic Casual mode of Global Offensive, while two can be obtained in Classic Competitive. 
                    However, players cannot acquire second one if they had already filled up their inventory with three other grenades and a flashbang, since four grenades are the absolute maximum amount of grenades a player can carry.

                    The Smoke Grenade is a type of grenade available in the Counter-Strike series.
                    Smoke grenades are grenades containing smoke composition (such as potassium chlorate and lactose) that releases clouds of smoke. 
                    In the Counter-Strike series, they are tactical tools that can be used to provide smoke screen cover, confuse the enemy, or hinder enemy visibility and discouraging them from attacking.
                    Players may only purchase one smoke grenade per round in Global Offensive to prevent smoke spamming.
                    When landing after being thrown, the smoke grenade will instantly release a cloud of smoke after a very short fuse time (the fuse time only starts after the grenade lands, so it will not explode midair). 
                    The dispersion deals no damage.
                    In Global Offensive, the smoke grenade instantly creates a thick, medium-sized (288 units diameter, or 144 units radius) smoke screen that lasts for 18 seconds after the fuse expires.
                </p>


                <div class="table-container">

                    <div class="right-content-grenade">

                            <p> 
                                The smoke screen is largely opaque except at the corners, blocking players' vision. 
                                If a player enters the smoke, the player's weapon model will fade slightly and all vision will be obscured.
                                The smoke grenade prevents vision-related gameplay elements from taking effect, such as being detected on the radar or having the player name shown when being aimed at. 
                                It prevents an enemy player appearing on the radar for 15 seconds.

                    The Decoy Grenade is a grenade featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
                    The Decoy Grenade is the cheapest grenade in Global Offensive, costing only $50. 
                    After being thrown, the grenade activates shortly after landing, and emits the sound of the user's most powerful weapon. 
                    As of the July 11, 2018 update, the Decoy Grenade shows up in the radars of the team that threw it as a grey dot.
                    After a certain period of time, the decoy grenade will self-detonate, but will not deal damage to teammates as of the July 23, 2020 update. 
                    For enemies, this remains at around 5 points of damager at point blank, or within a narrow radius.
                    If the player does not have any firearm equipped, the Decoy Grenade will mimic the user's starting pistol.
                    As a sniper, throwing a decoy grenade away from the player's position gives additional time for relocation or to move in for a kill.

                                It is recommended to use decoy grenades in combat situations as distracted enemies can have a hard time figuring out the difference between a decoy and a real enemy player mid fire-fight.
                                You can increase the effectiveness of this tactic by coordinating with your teammates to throw multiple decoys.
                                They can also help you guard corners, as rotating enemies may run towards the firefight, believing the remaining combatants are busy and won't be able to hear their footsteps.

                    The Zeus x27 is a piece of equipment featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2.
                    The Zeus x27 is an electroshock weapon based on the real-life Taser M26 Model. 
                    It is bought from the Equipment menu in the Buy menu and is equipped in the melee weapon slot when bought, alongside the player's knife. 
                    Unlike other equipment, the Zeus x27 can be purchased in Deathmatch. 
                    Whilst not originally a feature, a later update made it possible to drop the Zeus x27.
                    The Zeus fires a single short-range hit-scan projectile with very high damage. It will begin recharging upon use, and become usable again after thirty seconds. 
                    The Zeus has a very limited range, comparable to the knife. At very close ranges below 183 hammer units, it is capable of killing an enemy in one hit, regardless of armour. 
                    At between 183 and 230 hammer units, the Zeus deals high damage but will not kill instantly, and depending on the distance hit and the player's health, a player can survive a hit from the Zeus. At above 230 hammer units, the Zeus will do nothing. 
                    Kills with the Zeus award no money to the killer. 
                    The Zeus has extremely low running inaccuracy but significant jumping inaccuracy.
                </p>

                                Firing a Zeus makes a loud electric crack and creates a visible flash of electricity. Victims of the Zeus x27 make a distinctive, sharp scream, similar to the hostages' scream when they are harmed.
                                Never rush with this weapon, as its effective range is comparable to the optimal range of a shotgun. 
                                Enemies with even pistols can easily kill the player at range, and it is unlikely that the player can reach enemies when rushing at enemies in position.
                                Use the taser in enclosed areas or nearby entryways, or even airducts. 
                                Generally, once after an intended target appears within your sight and is in close proximity, that opponent will normally not have sufficient time to counter your strategy.
                                Economy-wise, the Zeus is an unreliable investment. 
                                While it is cheap, and it is possible to catch an enemy off guard and kill them instantly with a Zeus shot so the player can claim their weapons, knives and pistols are provided for free and award money upon making a kill.
                                In Danger Zone, the Zeus can be used to open a crate immediately. Taking the 30-second recharge to grab a primary weapon with haste is always worth it.

                    The Defuse Kit is a Counter-Terrorist exclusive equipment used to decrease the defuse time of bombs by half. 
                    Possessing the defuse kit adds a symbol of a pair of pliers to the player's HUD under the player's inventory. 
                    In Source and Global Offensive, when playing as a Counter-Terrorist or as a spectator, the scoreboard shows a defuser icon next to the name of the player for players possessing a defuse kit.
                    In Global Offensive, the defusal kit is given to all CT players for free in Casual Bomb Scenario at the start of a round. 
                    It still needs to be purchased in Competitive Bomb Scenario, costing 400$.   
                    If a Counter-Terrorist dies, their Defuse Kit will be dropped, and other Counter-Terrorist without a Defuse Kit can pick it up. 
                    Interestingly, if a CT begins defusing the bomb and had somehow picked up a defusal kit at the same time, the C4 will still require 10 seconds to defuse and not 5.
                </p>

                    <div class="right-content-grenade">

                            <p> 
                                This can be done by jumping on the C4, begin the defusal process, and then obtaining the defusal kit. 
                                However, if the defusal process is restarted when following the aforementioned fact, the bomb can be defused in 5 seconds.
                                It is often highly recommended to purchase a kit as a Counter-Terrorist to reduce the time it takes to defuse (this is especially helpful when "ninja" defusing). 
                                If a team is tighter on economy, then it is also viable to only have two players purchase defuse kits, one stationed at each bombsite to defuse the bomb when the site is clear, or let others pick up their kits to defuse if they die.
                                The Defusal kit is the standard equipment in Deleted Scenes. 
                                The player will automatically use it when defusing a bomb, and the defuse time is same as in multiplayer (5 seconds). 
                                However, the suitcase Nuke and sometimes bombs can also be defused like the C4 but slower and the time needed to defuse is same as defusing C4 without a kit (10 seconds).

                    The Kevlar Vest and Helmet, also known as simply Kevlar + Helmet, is a combination of protective equipment found in the Counter-Strike series. The Kevlar Vest can be purchased by itself, while the helmet cannot. 
                    A Kevlar Vest costs $650 and reduces damage taken by players from bullets and grenades by a percentage that varies with the armor penetration of each weapon. 
                    The Kevlar Vest protects the chest, stomach and the arm areas of the hitbox while the helmet protects the head. 
                    The legs are always unprotected.
