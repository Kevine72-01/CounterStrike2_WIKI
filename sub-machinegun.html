                    The MP7 is a submachine gun featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2, available to both factions. 
                    It is the successor to the K&M Sub-Machine Gun in previous Counter-Strike games, having similar performance and the same role as its predecessor.
                    In-game, the MP7 has a 30-round capacity, carries a large 120 rounds in reserve, and (despite its description) costs a relatively cheap $1500, though compared to the rest of the SMG class it is the second most expensive option.
                    The MP7 deals moderate damage, and is able to achieve a 2-headshot kill against armored users. 
                    Its rate of fire is high, and recoil and spread (including moving spread) is low and controllable, making it easy to use on the move.
                    Being an SMG, it has high damage dropoff and low armor penetration. 
                    The weapon is unusually heavy for its class (even heavier than the P90 and the UMP-45) and has a slightly long reload.

                                What ultimately makes it less popular is its high price compared to the rest of the SMG family, which restricts its use to more situational cases.
                                Like other SMGs, the MP7 awards 2× the money per kill than normal ($600 in Competitive Mode, $300 in Casual Mode).                            
                                Being an SMG, its penetration power is at 100, which means it cannot penetrate through metal and other similar tough materials.
                                The in-game MP7 is modeled after the MP7A1, and is modeled with a longer 40-round magazine.

                    The MP9 is a submachine gun featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2, exclusive to the Counter-Terrorists. 
                    It is the successor to the Schmidt Machine Pistol in previous Counter-Strike games, having similar statistics and the same role as its predecessor. 
                    The counterpart for Terrorists is the MAC-10.
                    In-game, the MP9 is a cheap SMG available to the CTs. 
                    It boasts a high rate of fire, fast movement speed, and swift reload time. 
                    It also has very impressive accuracy statistics across, particularly when moving and jumping, with its jumping accuracy being the highest of all SMGs and even higher than its running accuracy. 
                    This makes the MP9 one of the better "spray 'n' pray" weapons. Its damage dropoff is surprisingly the lowest out of all SMGs.
                    However, the MP9 suffers from high recoil, low damage, and low penetration power, making the weapon favoured in anti-eco rounds (where it can achieve one-hit headshot kills against unarmored opponents) but always swapped out for rifles or the P90.

                                As with most other SMGs in CS:GO, the MP9 awards twice the money for a kill compared to most weapons ($600 in Competitive Mode, $300 in Casual Mode).
                                The MP9 is a 9mm machine pistol manufactured by Switzerland-based Brügger & Thomet AG, and is a development of the Steyr TMP (Brügger & Thomet purchased the design rights from Steyr in 2001). 
                                Differences from the TMP include a new Picatinny rail for attachments, a right-side folding stock, and a new safety trigger.

                    The MAC-10 is a machine pistol featured in the Counter-Strike series, exclusive to the Terrorists. 
                    The counterpart for Counter-Terrorists is the TMP before Global Offensive and MP9 in Global Offensive.
                    In-game, the MAC-10 is a moderately powerful machine pistol available to only the Terrorists. 
                    It has a very high rate of fire and medium damage, and is a relatively cheap option ($1400 in earlier games and $1050 in Global Offensive).
                    The major disadvantages are its high damage dropoff (though its higher base damage compensates for it somewhat), bad accuracy (though moving inaccuracy is relatively low) and high recoil, which is mostly horizontal. 
                    Its armor penetration is also weak, making it unsuitable for later rounds. 
                    The weapon is very light and allows for a high movement speed. The MAC-10's reload time is somewhat long before Global Offensive, but is significantly shortened in Global Offensive.

                                In Global Offensive, the MAC-10 has an increased kill reward ($600) due to being a sub-machinegun.
                                Prior to Global Offensive, if equipped at the same time with the K&M .45 Tactical, the two will share an ammo pool of 100 rounds as they share the same cartridge.
                                The MAC-10 (Military Armament Corporation Model 10, officially the M-10) is a compact, blowback operated machine pistol developed by Gordon B. Ingram in 1964.

                    The PP-Bizon is a submachine gun featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2.
                    With its 64-round helical magazine, the Bizon has the largest magazine and reserve capacity out of all SMGs and among most weapons, only beaten by Light Machine Guns. 
                    It is lightweight and cheap, has a high fire rate and low recoil, and reloads quickly. 
                    The main problem with the Bizon is its low armour penetration, poor damage, range, and overall inferiority to the P90 and rifles, making it generally unviable for later competitive rounds.
                    The Bizon most often comes into play in anti-eco rounds, where it can shred through multiple opponents with the ability to kill in one headshot and a high rate of fire. 
                    Even then, its damage dropoff (20% reduction every 500 hammer units) limits its one-hit headshot kill range significantly.
                    The PP-19 Bizon (Пистолет-Пулемёт 19 "Бизон" — Submachine Gun 19 "Bison") is a Russian-made submachine gun manufactured by Izhmash in production since 1996.

                                Based on its design, the Bizon in-game fires a 64-round tubular magazine of 9x18mm Makarov pistol cartridge, which is the cartridge the Bizon is most commonly seen using. 
                                It is available for both factions. The player can carry 120 reserve rounds for this weapon.
                                It is generally not recommended to purchase the PP-Bizon due to its low damage. Weapons like the UMP-45 are usually better eco-round submachine gun options.

                    The UMP-45, or KM UMP45, as it was previously known, is a submachine gun featured in the Counter-Strike series.
                    Being an SMG, the UMP-45 is relatively lightweight, but slightly heavier than other SMGs in Global Offensive, tied with P90. 
                    It had low armor penetration penetration power before Global Offensive, but a relatively high armor penetration in Global Offensive.
                    Together it is a popular weapon in Global Offensive, having cheapness while also sporting high damage as well as high armor penetration. 
                    The result is the second highest DPS against armored opponents among the SMGs, only beaten by the P90, and it is a strong choice in eco and anti-eco rounds.
                    Notably the UMP-45 is significantly cheaper than the P90; for CT side, the UMP-45 is the cheapest SMG, and it is also the second cheapest T SMG option. 
                     As with most other SMGs in CS:GO, the UMP-45 awards twice the money for a kill compared to most weapons ($600 in Competitive Mode, $300 in Casual Mode).

                                Despite its high damage potential, it has the lowest rate of fire out of all SMGs, and remains so even after a fire rate buff in Global Offensive. 
                                This however gives it a very controllable recoil, and it also has a very good first shot and moving accuracy. 
                                The weapon's magazine capacity is relatively low, and its reload time is relatively long. 
                                The weapon also has restricted its ability at range due to a high damage dropoff, the highest decrease out of all SMGs.

                    The MP5-SD is a weapon available in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive & Counter-Strike 2, which was added in the August 15, 2018 patch. 
                    It is a successor to the MP5 seen in the previous Counter-Strike games.
                    The MP5-SD is a submachine gun featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as an alternative to the MP7 and is available to both teams. 
                    It was added as part of the August 15, 2018 update. Unlike the MP5 that was featured in earlier games, it features an integrated silencer, and can not be removed, allowing it to fill the role previously filled by the TMP.
                    The max audible distance of firing sound the MP5-SD is 1000 units.
                    The MP5-SD is suppressed, which greatly reduces its firing sound and allows for more stealthy engagements than the MP7.
                    This weapon can be extremely effective in Ancient. Burst 3-6 bullets at long or medium range and spray at short/medium range. 
                    This is especially useful on the Counter-Terrorists side when heading to Split via A Main.

                                The MP5-SD is often regarded as an inferior choice to its equivalent, the MP7, as despite the suppressor adding the opportunity for stealthy kills, the low damage output can often hamper use in aggressive plays and spray-downs common to SMGs.

                    The P90 or ES C90, as it was previously known, is a submachine gun featured in the Counter-Strike series.
                    Although not commonly used in Pro League matches due to its high cost, the P90 is very popular among lower-level players who favor a rushing playstyle. 
                    Its high magazine size allows this SMG to be used for spraying bullets.
                    It has a controllable recoil even with continuous fire and acceptable accuracy (which has been further decreased in Global Offensive) that is good enough for medium range but inaccurate for long range, which also doesn't increase very much when moving, allowing it to be used on the move.
                    Its damage is relatively low compared to other SMGs, unable to instantly kill unarmored enemies with 1 headshot in CS 1.6 and CS:CZ.
                    This is compensated with its generous 50 round magazine and excellent rate of fire. Its armor penetration is good, especially in Source, but due to its relatively low damage multiple shots are still needed to bring down armored opponents.

                                The P90 is heavier than other SMGs. 
                                In earlier games, this translates to a small decrease in speed whereas other SMGs have no speed reduction, while in Global Offensive (where all SMGs have small speed reduction) it slows down the player to a medium movement speed.
                                In Global Offensive, unlike other SMGs, the P90 has a standard kill reward instead of double kill reward at $300 in Competitive and $150 in Casual.
